Each student will make a short 5 minute presentation to the class on a specific topic within Game Design. Topics may vary, but the intention is to teach the underlying ideas / theory / terminology / application / etc. of your topic to the class.

You may use presentation slides if needed, but there should only be a few slides for the length of your talk.

Some things to consider when structuring your talk:

* What is your talk focusing on? Try and be as specific as possible and explain the context of what part of the game design elements this is related to.
* What is the necessary background needed in order to explain your topic? Briefly provide the necessary context.
* Consider demonstrating your topic (using 3rd party images is OK as long as you cite them).
	* If you want to use a video, only use a brief clip no more than 30 seconds.
* What resources are available for students to learn more about your topic?
